# Index Folder

The `scripts/index` folder is intended for scripts and modules related to creating, managing, and querying an index of document embeddings. In a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) system, an index is crucial for efficiently finding the most relevant text chunks based on a user's query.

- `__init__.py`: This file is empty and marks the `index` folder as a Python package.

**Purpose and Integration:**
Once text chunks have been converted into numerical embeddings (by scripts in the `scripts/embeddings/` folder), these embeddings need to be stored in a way that allows for fast similarity searches. This is typically done using a vector index or a vector database (e.g., FAISS, Pinecone, ChromaDB).

This folder would house the logic for:
- **Index Creation**: Scripts to build an index from a collection of embeddings.
- **Index Storage**: Modules for saving the index to disk and loading it back.
- **Index Updates**: Functionality to add new embeddings to an existing index or update/delete existing ones.
- **Search/Query Interface**: Low-level functions to perform similarity searches against the index, retrieving the IDs or content of the most relevant chunks for a given query embedding.

While currently containing only the initializer, the scripts in this folder will be responsible for the core retrieval mechanism's backend, enabling the `scripts/retrieval/` components to fetch relevant context for the RAG system.
